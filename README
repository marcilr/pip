  Python package installer
  A tool for installing and managing Python packages
  pip is a Python package installer, recommended for installing
  Python packages which are not available in the Debian archive.
  It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git,
  Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and
  prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before
  starting installation.
