Installation of pip (python package installer) for Python 2.6
under Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.10 (Santiago
(on State of Alaska OIT DNR intdev system)

The latest version of pip runs against the lastet
stable version python.  Since the intdev system is
running older Python 2.6 a compatible version of pip
needed to be installed,


Used the following procedure to install pip
for Python 2.6

Verify python2.6 available:
  # type python2.6
  python2.6 is /usr/bin/python2.6
  #

pip is in the epel package:
  Checking if installed:
  # yum list | grep ^epel
  epel-release.noarch       6-8    @/epel-release-latest-6.noar$
  epel-rpm-macros.noarch    6-21   epel
  #


1. Remove non-working pip (lasted version):

Verify latest pip in python-pip package:
# yum list installed | grep pip
python-pip.noarch   7.1.0-1.el6   @epel
#

# repoquery --list python-pip | grep bin
/usr/bin/pip
/usr/bin/pip2
/usr/bin/pip2.6
#

# yum remove python-pip
Loaded plugins: product-id, refresh-packagekit, search-disabled-repos,

2. Install pip for python 2.6

Just follow the instructions here:
  1. Securely download get-pip.py.[1]
  2. In the directory you saved get-pip.py, run
     sudo python2.6 get-pip.py

  and you'll be all set.

  This will install pip for Python 2.6, and won't
  touch your version 2.7 installation.

[1] get-pip.py
These abstract steps look great.  However, the referenced
get-pip.py did not work on intdev.  Has some type of
incompatibility.  Used script from stackoverflow below
that resolved the issue.
